# BTC_Twitter_sentiment_analysis

With this script, I will downloaded and analyzed 100.000 Bitcoin (BTC) tweets from 2022-11-01 to 2022-11-15 and performed sentiment analysis to gather market intelligence. The aim of the analysis is to understand what are peopleâ€™s opinions about BTC tweets.

Sentiment analysis consists of converting a text into a score that estimates its sentiment (e.g., demand for a given product) and can be deemed as a classification task (e.g., to extract subjectivity and sentiment polarity from text data).

Web scraping is done using snscrape (https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape). \
Filtering for English language is done using langdetect (https://github.com/Mimino666/langdetect). \
Sentiment analysis is done using spacytextblob (https://github.com/SamEdwardes/spacytextblob).

Scraped data looked like this: \
